### 1. Process Overview
Hammering, technically referred to as Smith Forging or Open Die Forging, involves the shaping of metal through the application of localized compressive forces via a handheld or power hammer. The process is predominantly conducted as a "Hot Working" operation, performed above the metal's recrystallization temperature to minimize flow stress and maximize ductility.

### 2. Safety Protocols
Strict adherence to safety standards is mandatory during high-temperature manufacturing processes.

* **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Operators must utilize heat-resistant Kevlar/leather gloves, leather aprons, face shields or safety goggles, and metatarsal-guarded safety boots.
* **Thermal Hazard Management:** Assume all metal surfaces are hot. Use designated tongs for all material handling.
* **Tool Integrity:** Inspect hammer heads for security (wedges) and ensure tongs are sized correctly for the stock to prevent projectile accidents.

### 3. Equipment and Tooling
The following apparatus is required for the execution of manual hot forging:

* **Heating Element:** Forge (Gas-fired, Coal, or Induction) capable of sustaining temperatures >1000°C.
* **Support Structure:** Anvil (Cast steel or wrought iron) featuring a flat face, horn, and hardy hole.
* **Striking Tools:** Ball-peen hammer, Cross-peen hammer, and Sledgehammer.
* **Holding Devices:** Tongs (Wolf-jaw, Bolt, or V-bit profiles).
* **Measuring Instruments:** Steel calipers and metal rules (plastic is prohibited due to thermal sensitivity).

### 4. Operational Procedure

#### Phase 1: Billet Preparation and Heating
1.  **Material Inspection:** Verify the raw stock (billet) is free from surface cracks or excessive rust.
2.  **Thermal Cycle:** Insert the billet into the forge's "hot zone."
3.  **Temperature Monitoring:** Heat the low-carbon steel specimen to the austenitic range (approximately 800°C – 1150°C).
    * *Visual Indicator:* The material should exhibit a bright orange to yellow incandescence.
    * *Caution:* Avoid reaching the "burning point" (white heat with sparking), which indicates incipient melting and grain boundary degradation.



#### Phase 2: Deformation (The Hammering Cycle)
1.  **Extraction:** Remove the billet using tongs, ensuring a firm grip to resist impact, and transfer immediately to the anvil face.
2.  **Primary Shaping:** Apply compressive impact force using the hammer. Common operations include:
    * **Drawing Out:** Reducing the cross-sectional area while increasing length.
    * **Upsetting:** Reducing length to increase the cross-sectional area.
    * **Fullering:** Using the hammer peen to create grooves or stretch material laterally.
3.  **Re-crystallization Management:** As the workpiece cools to a dull red color (approx. 700°C), plastic deformation becomes difficult and the risk of fracture increases. Cease hammering immediately and return the workpiece to the forge for reheating.



#### Phase 3: Finishing and Dimensioning
1.  **Planishing:** Utilize light, rapid blows at lower temperatures (dull red) to smooth surface irregularities and refine the geometric profile.
2.  **Dimensional Verification:** Check final dimensions against engineering drawings using calipers, accounting for thermal contraction (approx. 1-2% shrinkage upon cooling).

### 5. Post-Processing and Cooling
* **Normalization:** Place the forged component on a bed of sand or dry brick to allow for uniform air cooling. This restores the grain structure and relieves internal stresses induced by mechanical working.
* **Quenching (Specific Applications):** If martensitic transformation is required for hardness, rapid cooling in oil or water may be performed, depending on the carbon equivalence of the steel.

### 6. Defect Analysis
Common metallurgical defects arising from improper procedure:

| Defect | Technical Cause | Corrective Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cold Shut / Lap** | Material folding over itself without fusing due to improper flow. | Grind out the fold immediately; ensure proper hammer angle. |
| **Surface Cracking** | Forging performed below the recrystallization temperature (cold working). | Maintain strict temperature control; reheat frequently. |
| **Scale Pitting** | Embedding of iron oxide (scale) into the workpiece surface. | Utilize a wire brush to descale the billet before hammering. |
